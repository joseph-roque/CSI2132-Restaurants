While my two friends thoroughly enjoyed their dinner as meat eaters, as a vegetarian I felt my experience was very lackluster. We were asked if there were any food allergies, but in no way were we informed that there was a separate vegetarian menu that you needed to ask for (and I did not inform the waiter I was vegetarian- since it is not an allergy!). How was I supposed to know that there was another menu?? I had no advance knowledge of this special menu, apparently I should have researched more and possibly would have better enjoyed my experience. Instead, my friends and I shared three cheese samples, that were tasty but very small. I had a bland carrot soup and a overpriced fig salad, both of which I could have made myself at home and tasted much better. Overall it was not a bad experience, but I felt left out from enjoying what I was hoping would be an excellent dining experience because of this hidden vegetarian menu.

Last week I ordered the seafood tofu (the dish I always get) and was anxiously waiting for my food. When it arrived, the broth was tasteless and the seafood consisted of 1 shrimp, 1 mussel, and a chopped piece of cuttlefish tentacle for the price of $13.95. As usual, they would come ask how our food were. For the first time, I brought up my concern regarding the tofu I ordered. I explained that the dish tasted different from before since there is no flavour to it. The waiter politely addressed my concern and brought it back in the kitchen. When the dish came back, it was really salty to the point I cannot finish it. They came back and I told them it was too salty. When it was time to leave, the waiter came again and asked me if I wanted to pack it and I said no. They did not make an effort to show that they are sorry and instead said oh maybe you do not like the korean tofu dish. They charged me in full for the dish even though I took only a few bites. Because of this, I will never return again since they never offered to cancel the dish or ask if I wanted another item (not like I would have accepted it but it would have been a nice gesture).....very disappointed :(', 3),

Would one not think that if it was down there would either be a note on the website or a phone call to those whos orders do not go through? There was not.

The butter chicken was okay, portion sizes were a little small and it just was not worth the money. The worst part is when I tasted my drink and realized it was off and saw that it expired in September of 2014. Gross!
